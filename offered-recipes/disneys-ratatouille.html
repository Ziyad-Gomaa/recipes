    <h4><em>A beautifully arranged, modern version of a traditional French vegetable stew.</em></h4>
    <p>This ratatouille recipe makes the elegant French vegetable dish served up in the Disney movie of the same name.<br>
       Long and narrow slices of colorful eggplant, zucchini, and summer squash work best and turn out tender every time!</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
        <li>½ onion, chopped</li>
        <li>¼ cup minced garlic</li>
        <li>¾ cup water</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 small eggplant, trimmed and very thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 zucchini, trimmed and very thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 yellow squash, trimmed and very thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, cored and very thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 yellow bell pepper, cored and very thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves, or to taste</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons mascarpone cheese (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Spread tomato paste onto the bottom of a 10-inch square baking dish.<br>
            Sprinkle with onion and garlic. Stir in water and 1 tablespoon olive<br> 
            oil until thoroughly combined. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Arrange alternating slices of eggplant, zucchini, yellow squash, red<br>
            bell pepper, and yellow bell pepper, starting at the outer edge of the<br> 
            dish and working concentrically towards the center. Overlap slices a<br> 
            little to display colors.</li>
        <li>Drizzle vegetables with remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil; season with<br>
            salt and pepper. Sprinkle with thyme leaves. Cover vegetables with a<br>
            piece of parchment paper cut to fit inside.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until vegetables are roasted and tender,<br> 
            about 45 minutes. Serve with dollops of mascarpone cheese if desired.</li>
    </ol>
